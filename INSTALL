How to backup a DVD-Video under Linux with help of dvdbackup


Install:
--------

Download dvdbackup version 0.1 - you will also need libdvdread version 0.9.3 or later.

Compile dvdbackup.c in the src dir like this gcc -o dvdbackup \
-I/my/prefix/to/libdvdread/include -L/my/prefix/to/libdvdread/lib \
-ldvdread dvdbackup.c

NOTE: The "\" indicates that it's one line - i.e. remove the "\" from the command
line



Prerequisites:
--------------

Prerequisite that you have a DVD-Video that you can backup - NOTE 
it's not legal to backup a DVD-Video that you don't own! 


How to backup:
--------------

If you just want to backup everything (all video dvdbackup doesn't backup 
any computer files) use.

dvdbackup -M -i/dev/dvd -o/my/dvd/backup/dir/

dvdbackup will create a DVD-Video structure under /my/dvd/backup/dir/TITLE_NAME/
Since the title is "uniq" you can use the same dir for all your DVD backups.
If the DVD  happens to have a generic title dvdbackup will exit with a return 
value of 2. And you will need to specify a title name with the -n switch. 

If you are backing up a DVD-5 (single layer DVD) you can actually burn the 
DVD-Video structure to a DVD-/+R(W) disk. Please see dvdburn for instructions.

You can also backup a title set with the -T switch, gather info of the DVD with
the -I switch, etc. dvdbackup has many features please see the README file
for more information.


Happy backup!
